 * Function Name: Puzzle - loads the data from the file into a 2-D array

 * Loads the puzzle from the p2.txt file into a two dimensional array of 
 * characters. Checks to make sure that the file isn't empty or non-rectangular.
 * Then, enters the first row of the board into the array and then enters the 
 * following rows until there are no more lines to read in the file. 
 * Entry Parameters: none
 * Return Values: none
